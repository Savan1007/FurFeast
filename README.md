## **💡 Project Idea**
**WhiskerBytes** is a **web-based platform** that automates **food donation, request tracking, and inventory management** for the **Regina Humane Society (RHS)**. It replaces the existing **manual tracking process** with a **centralized, real-time system** to improve **efficiency, accuracy, and scalability**.

## **🌍 Project Background & Business Opportunity**
### **Why WhiskerBytes? 🤔**
The **Regina Humane Society (RHS)** currently **relies on outdated manual tracking methods**—using **spreadsheets, phone calls, and paper logs**—to manage food donations, inventory, and distributions. This fragmented approach causes inefficiencies, making it harder to **streamline donations**, **track inventory accurately**, and **ensure food reaches those in need on time**. 📉

### **Challenges Faced:**
- **⏳ Time-consuming** – Staff spend excessive hours handling manual entries and coordinating donations over calls.
- **⚠️ Prone to errors** – Paper logs lead to miscommunication and data loss.
- **📊 Difficult to scale** – The increasing volume of donations and requests makes manual tracking unsustainable.

### **🚀 Innovation & Business Need**
**WhiskerBytes** is a **game-changer** in food donation management. By **eliminating manual errors** and **enhancing coordination**, this platform ensures a **faster, transparent, and reliable process** for managing food distribution. 🏆

With WhiskerBytes, we bring a **fully digital, structured approach** to food donation management, enabling:
✅ **Automated food request and approval system** – Reducing reliance on phone-based coordination.  
✅ **Real-time inventory tracking** – Ensuring updated stock availability for RHS staff.  
✅ **Supplier & donor self-service dashboard** – Allowing direct logging of food donations.  
✅ **Automated reporting & analytics** – Providing accurate, real-time insights into food donations and distributions.  

📡 **Scalability & Future Vision**
Beyond RHS, **WhiskerBytes** has the potential to **transform food donation management** across **multiple non-profits** in Regina. The next step will be expanding the system to **Al Ritchie Community Association**, with long-term scalability to support **regional and national food distribution networks**. Our vision is to build a **versatile, sustainable, and impactful** platform that ensures **no food goes to waste** while efficiently **feeding those in need**. 🌱💡
